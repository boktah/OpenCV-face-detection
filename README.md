# OpenCV-face-detection

**Steps:**
1) Run faces-creation.py to take several pictures of your face. Best results when you take pictures in various lighting and settings.
Assign a name, take pictures by pressing the 'A' key, and press 'Q' when you have a sufficient data set (at least 5 images).

2) Run faces-train.py to process the faces you gave the program.

3) Run faces.py to see the results of OpenCV's facial detection algorithms.
